    Master&lt;/a>. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish&#xD;
    their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed&#xD;
    to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to&#xD;
    optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental&#xD;
    deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.&#xD;

    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Sprint Progress&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;
    Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum. The Development Team tracks these sums daily and&#xD;
    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;
    variables of interest.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    Sprint Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Development Team works, it keeps this goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the&#xD;
    functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, then they&#xD;
    collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal may be a milestone in the larger purpose of the product roadmap.&#xD;
