    collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.&#xD;

    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;

    Master&lt;/a>. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish&#xD;
    their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed&#xD;
    to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to&#xD;
    optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental&#xD;
    deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.&#xD;
