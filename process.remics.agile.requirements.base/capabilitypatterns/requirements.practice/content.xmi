    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Sprint Progress&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;
    Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum. The Development Team tracks these sums daily and&#xD;
    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;
    variables of interest.&#xD;

&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Development Team works, it keeps this goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the&#xD;
    functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, then they&#xD;
    collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal may be a milestone in the larger purpose of the product roadmap.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to&#xD;
    be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, and&#xD;
    estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product Backlog items drive&#xD;
    immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product Backlog item has been considered, and the&#xD;
    more consensus exists regarding it and its value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work&#xD;
    on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is then employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an&#xD;
    ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog&#xD;
    items. During Product Backlog grooming, items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the&#xD;
    Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.&#xD;

    Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Often the&#xD;
    Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the&#xD;
    Scrum Team. Grooming usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping&#xD;

    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;

    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;

    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;

    Sprint Review&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.&#xD;
    During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that&#xD;
    and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done.&#xD;
    This is an informal meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster&#xD;
    collaboration.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less time is allocated for shorter&#xD;
    Sprints. For example, two week Sprints have two-hour Sprint Reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Review includes the following elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner identifies what has been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems&#xD;
        were solved;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on&#xD;
        progress to date; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent&#xD;
        Sprint Planning Meetings.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the&#xD;
    next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Product Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of&#xD;
    requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    including its content, availability, and ordering.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and&#xD;
    best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used&#xD;
    evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate,&#xD;
    competitive, and useful. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to&#xD;
    be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, and&#xD;
    estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product Backlog items drive&#xD;
    immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product Backlog item has been considered, and the&#xD;
    more consensus exists regarding it and its value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are&#xD;
    made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items&#xD;
    that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one&#xD;
    item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within&#xD;
    one Sprint are deemed “ready” or “actionable” for selection in a Sprint Planning Meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and&#xD;
    more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business&#xD;
    requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work&#xD;
    on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is then employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an&#xD;
    ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog&#xD;
    items. During Product Backlog grooming, items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the&#xD;
    Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Often the&#xD;
    Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the&#xD;
    Scrum Team. Grooming usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping&#xD;
    understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work&#xD;
    remaining at least for every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous&#xD;
    Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information&#xD;
    is made transparent to all stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Various trend burndown, burnup and other projective practices have been used to forecast progress. These have proven&#xD;
    useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is&#xD;
    unknown. Only what has happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.&#xD;

    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Sprint Progress&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;
    Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum. The Development Team tracks these sums daily and&#xD;
    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;
    variables of interest.&#xD;

    Sprint Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Development Team works, it keeps this goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the&#xD;
    functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, then they&#xD;
    collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal may be a milestone in the larger purpose of the product roadmap.&#xD;

    Product Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of&#xD;
    requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    including its content, availability, and ordering.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and&#xD;
    best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used&#xD;
    evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate,&#xD;
    competitive, and useful. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to&#xD;
    be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, and&#xD;
    estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product Backlog items drive&#xD;
    immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product Backlog item has been considered, and the&#xD;
    more consensus exists regarding it and its value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are&#xD;
    made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items&#xD;
    that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one&#xD;
    item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within&#xD;
    one Sprint are deemed “ready” or “actionable” for selection in a Sprint Planning Meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and&#xD;
    more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business&#xD;
    requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work&#xD;
    on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is then employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an&#xD;
    ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog&#xD;
    items. During Product Backlog grooming, items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the&#xD;
    Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Often the&#xD;
    Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the&#xD;
    Scrum Team. Grooming usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping&#xD;
    understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work&#xD;
    remaining at least for every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous&#xD;
    Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information&#xD;
    is made transparent to all stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Various trend burndown, burnup and other projective practices have been used to forecast progress. These have proven&#xD;
    useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is&#xD;
    unknown. Only what has happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Development Team works, it keeps this goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the&#xD;
    functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, then they&#xD;
    collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal may be a milestone in the larger purpose of the product roadmap.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of&#xD;
    requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    including its content, availability, and ordering.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and&#xD;
    best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used&#xD;
    evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate,&#xD;
    competitive, and useful. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to&#xD;
    be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, and&#xD;
    estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product Backlog items drive&#xD;
    immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product Backlog item has been considered, and the&#xD;
    more consensus exists regarding it and its value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are&#xD;
    made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items&#xD;
    that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one&#xD;
    item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within&#xD;
    one Sprint are deemed “ready” or “actionable” for selection in a Sprint Planning Meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and&#xD;
    more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business&#xD;
    requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work&#xD;
    on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is then employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an&#xD;
    ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog&#xD;
    items. During Product Backlog grooming, items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the&#xD;
    Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Often the&#xD;
    Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the&#xD;
    Scrum Team. Grooming usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping&#xD;
    understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work&#xD;
    remaining at least for every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous&#xD;
    Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information&#xD;
    is made transparent to all stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Various trend burndown, burnup and other projective practices have been used to forecast progress. These have proven&#xD;
    useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is&#xD;

    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Sprint Progress&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;
    Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum. The Development Team tracks these sums daily and&#xD;
    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;
    variables of interest.&#xD;

    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Sprint Progress&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;
    Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum. The Development Team tracks these sums daily and&#xD;
    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;
    variables of interest.&#xD;

    Product Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of&#xD;
    requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    including its content, availability, and ordering.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and&#xD;
    best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used&#xD;
    evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate,&#xD;
    competitive, and useful. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to&#xD;
    be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, and&#xD;
    estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product Backlog items drive&#xD;
    immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product Backlog item has been considered, and the&#xD;
    more consensus exists regarding it and its value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are&#xD;
    made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items&#xD;
    that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one&#xD;
    item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within&#xD;
    one Sprint are deemed “ready” or “actionable” for selection in a Sprint Planning Meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and&#xD;
    more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business&#xD;
    requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work&#xD;
    on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is then employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an&#xD;
    ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog&#xD;
    items. During Product Backlog grooming, items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the&#xD;
    Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Often the&#xD;
    Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the&#xD;
    Scrum Team. Grooming usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping&#xD;
    understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work&#xD;
    remaining at least for every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous&#xD;
    Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information&#xD;
    is made transparent to all stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Various trend burndown, burnup and other projective practices have been used to forecast progress. These have proven&#xD;
    useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is&#xD;
    unknown. Only what has happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.&#xD;
