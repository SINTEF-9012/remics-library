    Opportunity&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the&#xD;
    team’s shared understanding of the stakeholders’ needs, and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by&#xD;
    providing justification for its development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Associations&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        focuses : Requirements Opportunity focuses Requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Justification: Why Opportunity?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most software engineering work is initiated by the stakeholders that own and use the software system. Their inspiration&#xD;
    is usually some combination of problems, suggestions and directives, which taken together provide the development team&#xD;
    with an opportunity to create a new or improved software system. Occasionally it is the development team itself that&#xD;
    originates the opportunity that they must then sell to the other stakeholders to get funding and support. In many cases&#xD;
    the software system only provides part of the solution needed to exploit the opportunity and the development team must&#xD;
    co-ordinate their work with other teams to ensure that they actually deliver a useful, and deployable system.&lt;br />&#xD;
    In all cases understanding the opportunity is an essential part of software engineering, as it enables the team to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify and motivate their stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the value that the software system offers to the stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand why the software system is being developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand how the success of the deployment of the software system will be judged.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the software system effectively addresses the needs of all the stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is the opportunity that unites the stakeholders and provides the motivation for producing a new or updated software&#xD;
    system. It is by understanding the opportunity that you can identify the value, and the desired outcome that the&#xD;
    stakeholders hope to realize from the use of the software system either alone or as part of a broader business, or&#xD;
    technical solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Progressing the Opportunity&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the development of a software system the opportunity progresses through several state changes. As presented in&#xD;
    Figure 10, these are identified, solution needed, value established, viable, addressed, and benefit accrued. These&#xD;
    states indicate significant points in the team’s progression of the opportunity from the initial formulation of an idea&#xD;
    to use a software system through to the accrual of benefit from its use. They indicate (1) when the opportunity is&#xD;
    first identified, (2) when the opportunity has been analyzed and it has been confirmed that a solution is needed, (3)&#xD;
    when the opportunity’s value is established and the desired outcomes required of the solution are clear, (4) when&#xD;
    enough is known about the cost of creating and using the proposed solution that it is clear that the pursuit of the&#xD;
    opportunity is viable, (5) when a solution is available that demonstrably shows that the opportunity has been&#xD;
    addressed, and finally (6) when benefit has been accrued from the use of the resulting solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As shown in Figure 10, the opportunity is first identified. The opportunity could be to entertain somebody, learn&#xD;
    something, make some money, or even to change the world. Regardless of the kind of opportunity presented, if it is not&#xD;
    understood by the team it is unlikely that they will produce an appropriate software system. For software engineering&#xD;
    endeavors the opportunity is usually identified by the stakeholders that own and use the software system, and typically&#xD;
    takes the form of an idea for a way to improve the current way of doing something, increase market share or apply a new&#xD;
    or innovative technology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Different stakeholders will see the opportunity in different ways, and they will be looking for different results from&#xD;
    any software system produced to address it. It is important that the different stakeholder perspectives are understood&#xD;
    and used&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/opportunity_states.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;438&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 10: The states of the Opportunity&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    to increase the team’s understanding of the opportunity. Analyzing the opportunity to understand the stakeholder’s&#xD;
    needs and any underlying problems is essential to ensure that an appropriate system is produced and a satisfactory&#xD;
    return-on-investment is generated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the opportunity has been analyzed, and it has been agreed that a software-based solution is needed, it is possible&#xD;
    to determine the value that the solution is expected to generate. Progressing the opportunity to value established is&#xD;
    an important step in determining whether or not to proceed with work to address the opportunity as it means that the&#xD;
    prize is clear to everyone involved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The next step is to establish the viability of the opportunity. An opportunity is viable when a solution can be&#xD;
    envisaged that it is feasible to develop and deploy within acceptable time and cost constraints. Although addressing&#xD;
    the opportunity may be a very valuable thing to do it is probably not a good idea if the resources expended will be&#xD;
    greater than the benefits accrued.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once it has been agreed that the opportunity is viable then the team can be confident that a software system can be&#xD;
    produced that will not just address the opportunity but will be acceptable to all of the stakeholders. As releases of&#xD;
    the software system become available their viability must be continuously checked to ensure that they meet the needs of&#xD;
    the stakeholders. After a suitable software system has been made available then, as far as the development team is&#xD;
    concerned, the opportunity has been addressed. Now the users of the system have to use it to generate value for any&#xD;
    benefit to be accrued.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important that the team understands the current state of the opportunity so that they can ensure that an&#xD;
    appropriate software system is developed, one that will satisfy the stakeholders and result in a tangible benefit being&#xD;
    accrued.&#xD;
