    Team&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery or support of a specific software system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One, or more, teams plan and perform the work needed to create, update and/or change the software system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Associations&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        produces : Software System Team produces Software System.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        performs and plans : Work Team performs and plans Work.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        applies : Way-of-Working Team applies Way-of-Working.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Justification: Why Team?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software engineering is a team sport involving the collaborative application of many different competencies and skills.&#xD;
    The effectiveness of a team has a profound effect on the success of any software engineering endeavor. To achieve high&#xD;
    performance, team members should reflect on how well they work together, and relate this to their potential and&#xD;
    effectiveness in achieving their mission.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Normally a team consists of several people. Occasionally, however, work may be undertaken by a single individual&#xD;
    creating software purely for their own use and entertainment. A team requires at least two people, but the guidance&#xD;
    provided by the Team Alpha can also be used to help single individuals when creating software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Progressing the Team&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Teams evolve during their time together and progress through several state changes. As shown in Figure 9, the states&#xD;
    are seeded, formed, collaborating, performing, and adjourned. They communicate the progression of a software team on&#xD;
    the journey from initial conception to the completion of the mission indicating (1) when the team is seeded and the&#xD;
    individuals start to join the team (2) when the team is formed to start the mission, (3) when the individuals start&#xD;
    collaborating effectively and truly become a team, (4) when the team is performing and achieves a crucial level of&#xD;
    efficiency and productivity, and (5) when the team is adjourned after completing its mission.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As shown in Figure 13, the team is first seeded. This implies defining the mission, deciding on recruitment for the&#xD;
    necessary skills, capabilities and responsibilities, and making sure that the conditions are right for an effective&#xD;
    group to come together. As the team is formed, the people in the group, and those joining it, bring the necessary&#xD;
    skills and experience to the team. The group becomes a team as the people begin to see how they can contribute to the&#xD;
    work at hand. As they discover and take account of each otherâ€™s capabilities, they start collaborating effectively and&#xD;
    make progress towards completing their mission.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At its peak of performing, the team shares a way of working, and plays to its strengths to complete its mission&#xD;
    effectively and efficiently. The performing team easily adapts to the changing context and takes appropriate measures.&#xD;
    If a number of people join or leave the team, or the context of the mission changes, it may revert to a previous state.&#xD;
    Finally, if the team has no further goals or missions to complete, it is adjourned.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to understand the current state of the team so that suitable practices can be used to address the&#xD;
    issues and impediments being faced, and to ensure that the team focuses on working effectively and efficiently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
