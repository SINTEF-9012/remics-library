    Stakeholders&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The stakeholders provide the opportunity, and are the source of the requirements for the software system. They are&#xD;
    involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system&#xD;
    is produced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Associations&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        provide : Opportunity Stakeholders provide Opportunity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        support : Team Stakeholders support Team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        demand : Requirements Stakeholders demand Requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        use and consume : Software System Stakeholders use and consume Software System.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Justification: Why Stakeholders?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders are critical to the success of the software system and the work done to produce it. Their input and&#xD;
    feedback help shape the software engineering endeavor and the resulting software system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Progressing the Stakeholders&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the development of a software system the stakeholders progress through several state changes. As shown in Figure&#xD;
    5, they are recognized, represented, involved, in agreement, satisfied for deployment and satisfied in use. These&#xD;
    states focus on the involvement and satisfaction of the stakeholders, from their recognition as stakeholders through&#xD;
    their representation in the development activities to their satisfaction with the use of the resulting software system.&#xD;
    The states communicate the progression of the relationship with the stakeholders who are either directly involved in&#xD;
    the software engineering endeavor or support it by providing input and feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/stakeholders_states.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 9: The states of the Stakeholders&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As indicated in Figure 9, the first thing to do is to make sure that the stakeholders affected by the proposed software&#xD;
    system are recognized. This means that all the different groups of stakeholders that are, or will be, affected by the&#xD;
    development and operation of the software system are identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The number and type of stakeholder groups to be identified can vary considerably from one system to another. For&#xD;
    example the nature and complexity of the system and its target operating environment, and the nature and complexity of&#xD;
    the development organization will both affect the number of stakeholder groups affected by the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is not always possible to have all the stakeholder groups involved. Focus should be primarily on the ones that are&#xD;
    critical to the success of the software engineering endeavor. It is these stakeholder groups that need to be directly&#xD;
    involved in the work. Their selection depends on the level of impact they have on the success of the software system&#xD;
    and the level of impact the software system has on them. The stakeholder groups that assure quality, fund, use, support&#xD;
    and maintain the software system should always be identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is not enough to determine which stakeholder groups need to be involved, they will also need to be actively&#xD;
    represented. This means that there will be one or more stakeholder representatives selected to represent each&#xD;
    stakeholder group, or in some cases one stakeholder representative selected to represent all stakeholder groups, and&#xD;
    help the team. To make the contribution of the stakeholder representatives as effective as possible, they must know&#xD;
    their roles and responsibilities within the software engineering endeavor. Without defining clear roles and&#xD;
    responsibilities, the software engineering endeavor runs the risk that some of its important aspects may get&#xD;
    unintentionally omitted or neglected.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Once the stakeholder representatives have been appointed, the represented state is achieved. Here, the stakeholder&#xD;
    representatives take on their agreed to responsibilities and feel fully committed to helping the new software system to&#xD;
    succeed. Acting as intermediaries between their respective stakeholder groups and the team, they are now granted&#xD;
    authority to carry out their responsibilities on behalf of their respective stakeholder groups.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team needs to make sure that the stakeholder representatives are actively involved in the development of the&#xD;
    software system. Here, the stakeholder representatives assist in the software engineering endeavor in accordance with&#xD;
    their responsibilities. They provide feedback and take part in decision making in a timely manner. In cases when&#xD;
    changes need to be done to the software system, or when the stakeholder group they represent suggests changes, the&#xD;
    stakeholder representatives make sure that the changes are relevant and promptly communicated to the team. No software&#xD;
    engineering endeavor is fixed from the beginning. Its requirements are continuously evolving as the opportunity changes&#xD;
    or new limitations are identified. This requires the stakeholder representatives to be actively involved throughout the&#xD;
    development and to be responsive to all the changes affecting their stakeholder group.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may not always be possible to meet all the expectations of all the stakeholders. Hence, compromises will have to be&#xD;
    made. In the in agreement state the stakeholder representatives have identified and agreed upon a minimal set of&#xD;
    expectations which have to be met before the system is deployed. These expectations will be reflected in the&#xD;
    requirements agreed by the stakeholder representatives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Throughout the development the stakeholder representatives provide feedback on the systemâ€™s state from the perspective&#xD;
    of their stakeholder groups. Once the minimal expectations of the stakeholder representatives have been achieved by the&#xD;
    new software system they will confirm that it is ready for operational use and the satisfied for deployment state is&#xD;
    achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finally, the stakeholders start to use the operational system and provide feedback on whether or not they are truly&#xD;
    satisfied with what has been delivered. Achieving the satisfied in use state indicates that the new system has been&#xD;
    successfully deployed and is delivering the expected benefits for all the stakeholder groups.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understanding the current state of the stakeholders and how they are progressing towards being satisfied with the new&#xD;
    system is a critical part of any software engineering endeavor.&#xD;
