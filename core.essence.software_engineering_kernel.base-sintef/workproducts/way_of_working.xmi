    Way-of-Working&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As&#xD;
    their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current&#xD;
    context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Justification: Why Way-of-Working?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software engineering is a team sport, one that requires the whole team to collaborate effectively regardless of how the&#xD;
    team is organized. They need to agree on a way of working that will support collaboration and guide them throughout the&#xD;
    software engineering endeavor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The way of working:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is key to enabling a team to work together effectively.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Focuses the team on how they will collaborate to ensure success.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enables the work to be planned and controlled.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Helps the team, and their associated stakeholders, to successfully fulfill their responsibilities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Progressing the Way-of-Working&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the course of a software engineering endeavor the way of working progresses through several state changes. As&#xD;
    presented in Figure 15, they are principles established, foundation established, in use, in place, working well, and&#xD;
    retired. These states focus on the way a team establishes an effective way-of-working indicating (1) when the&#xD;
    principles and constraints that shape the way-of-working are established, (2) when a minimal number of key practices&#xD;
    and tools have been identified and integrated to establish a foundation for the evolution of the team’s way-of-working,&#xD;
    (3) when the chosen way of working is in use by the team, (4) when a team’s way of working is in place and in use by&#xD;
    the whole team (5) when it is working well, and (6) when the way of working has been retired and is no longer in use by&#xD;
    the team. Examples of principles and constraints could be how far into the future you plan, governance policies, how&#xD;
    decisions are made, and how the work in broken down.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many ways of working that the team could adopt to meet their objectives and establish their approach to&#xD;
    software engineering. As shown in Figure 15, the first step in adopting a new way-of-working, or adapting an existing&#xD;
    way-of-working, is to understand the team’s working environment and establish the principles that will guide their&#xD;
    selection of appropriate practices and tools. This includes identifying the constraints governing the selection of the&#xD;
    team's practices and tools and understanding the practices and tools that the team, and their stakeholders, are already&#xD;
    using or are required to use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is not enough to just understand the principles and constraints that will inform the team's way of working. These&#xD;
    must be agreed with, and actively supported by, the team and its stakeholders. Once the principles are established the&#xD;
    team is ready to start selecting the practices and tools that will form their way-of-working.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To establish a natural way of working the focus should first be on the key practices and tools; those that bring the&#xD;
    team together, enable communication among the team members, support collaborative working and are essential to the&#xD;
    success of the team. However, these practices and tools act as the foundation for the team’s way-of-working. Before the&#xD;
    foundation can be assembled it is important to understand the gaps between the practices and tools needed by the team&#xD;
    and the practices, and tools immediately available to the team. This enables the activities needed to fill these gaps&#xD;
    to be planned.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the key practices and tools are integrated then the way-of-working’s foundation is established and the&#xD;
    way-of-working is ready to be trialed by the team. It will however be continuously adapted as the work progresses, and&#xD;
    additional practices and tools will be added as the team inspects their way-of-working and adapts it to meet their&#xD;
    changing circumstances.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Rather than spending more time tailoring or tuning the way-of-working it is important that the team puts it into use as&#xD;
    soon as possible. The way-of-working is in use as soon as any of the team members are using and adapting it as part of&#xD;
    completing their work. As more and more of the team start to use and benefit from the way-of-working its usage will&#xD;
    grow until it is firmly in place and all the team members are using it to accomplish their work. Some team members may&#xD;
    still need help to understand certain aspects of the team's way of working and to make effective progress, but the way&#xD;
    of working is now the normal way for the team to develop software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the team progresses through the work, the way of working will become embedded in their activities and collaborations&#xD;
    to such an extent that its use, inspection and adaptation are all seen as a natural part of the way the team works. The&#xD;
    way-of-working is working well once it has stabilized and all team members are making progress as planned by using and&#xD;
    adapting it to suit their current working environment. Finally, when the way of working is no longer in use by the&#xD;
    team, it is retired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understanding the current and desired state of the team's way of working helps a team to continually improve their&#xD;
    performance, and adapt quickly and effectively to change.&#xD;
