    Daily Scrum&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan&#xD;
    for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that&#xD;
    could be done before the next one.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting, each Development&#xD;
    Team member explains:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What has been accomplished since the last meeting?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will be done before the next meeting?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What obstacles are in the way?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to assess progress toward the Sprint Goal and to assess how progress is&#xD;
    trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the&#xD;
    Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. The Development Team often meets immediately after the Daily Scrum to&#xD;
    re-plan the rest of the Sprint’s work. Every day, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner&#xD;
    and Scrum Master how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the goal and create the&#xD;
    anticipated Increment in the remainder of the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for&#xD;
    conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute&#xD;
    time-box.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum&#xD;
    is not a status meeting, and is for the people transforming the Product Backlog items into an Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify and remove impediments to development,&#xD;
    highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of project knowledge. This is a&#xD;
    key inspect and adapt meeting.&#xD;

    Sprint Planning Meeting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning Meeting. This plan is created by the&#xD;
    collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Planning Meeting is time-boxed to eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is&#xD;
    proportionately shorter. For example, two-week Sprints have four-hour Sprint Planning Meetings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Planning Meeting consists of two parts, each one being a time-box of one half of the Sprint Planning Meeting&#xD;
    duration. The two parts of the Sprint Planning Meeting answer the following questions, respectively:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Part One: What will be done this Sprint?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this part, the Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The&#xD;
    Product Owner presents ordered Product Backlog items to the Development Team and the entire Scrum Team collaborates on&#xD;
    understanding the work of the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development&#xD;
    Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. The number of items selected from the Product&#xD;
    Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can&#xD;
    accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/workproducts/sprint_goal_C7293E60.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_6p8zUIcOEeKDAPAbcNl48A&quot;>Sprint Goal&lt;/a>. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint&#xD;
    through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is&#xD;
    building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Part Two: How will the chosen work get done?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having selected the work of the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done”&#xD;
    product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering&#xD;
    them is called the Sprint Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a&#xD;
    working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during the&#xD;
    Sprint Planning Meeting for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work&#xD;
    planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed to units of one day or less by the end&#xD;
    of this meeting. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during the&#xD;
    Sprint Planning Meeting and as needed throughout the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner may be present during the second part of the Sprint Planning Meeting to clarify the selected Product&#xD;
    Backlog items and to help make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it&#xD;
    may renegotiate the Sprint Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite other people to&#xD;
    attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and&#xD;
    Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated&#xD;
    Increment.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Sprint Retrospective&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to&#xD;
    be enacted during the next Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning Meeting. This is a&#xD;
    three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less time is allocated for shorter Sprints.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process framework, its development process and&#xD;
    practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team&#xD;
    plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/guidances/concepts/definition_of_done_B52B998F.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_tprjYBCzEeGhfJHCQDJMKQ&quot;>Definition of &quot;Done&quot;&lt;/a> as appropriate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in&#xD;
    the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum&#xD;
    Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal&#xD;
    opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.&#xD;

    Sprint Review&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.&#xD;
    During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that&#xD;
    and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done.&#xD;
    This is an informal meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster&#xD;
    collaboration.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less time is allocated for shorter&#xD;
    Sprints. For example, two week Sprints have two-hour Sprint Reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Review includes the following elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner identifies what has been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems&#xD;
        were solved;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on&#xD;
        progress to date; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent&#xD;
        Sprint Planning Meetings.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the&#xD;
    next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.&#xD;

    Development Team&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of&#xD;
    &quot;Done&quot; product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting&#xD;
    synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness. Development Teams have the following&#xD;
    characteristics:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog&#xD;
        into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being&#xD;
        performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to&#xD;
        the Development Team as a whole; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development Teams do not contain sub-teams dedicated to particular domains like testing or business analysis.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Development Team Size&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work. Fewer&#xD;
    than three Development Team members decreases interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller&#xD;
    Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to&#xD;
    deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination. Large&#xD;
    Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage. The Product Owner and Scrum Master&#xD;
    roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.&#xD;

    to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to&#xD;
    optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the&#xD;
    Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a backlog item’s priority must convince the Product Owner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Sprint Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product&#xD;
    Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what&#xD;
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done”&#xD;
    Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet&#xD;
    the Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The&#xD;
    Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This&#xD;
    emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the&#xD;
    Sprint Goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the&#xD;
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the&#xD;
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time&#xD;
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the&#xD;
    Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Sprint Progress&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be summed. The Development&#xD;
    Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum. The Development Team tracks these sums daily and&#xD;
    projects the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the&#xD;
    Development Team can manage its progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only&#xD;
    variables of interest.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    Sprint Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Development Team works, it keeps this goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the&#xD;
    functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, then they&#xD;
    collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Goal may be a milestone in the larger purpose of the product roadmap.&#xD;

    Product Backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of&#xD;
    requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog,&#xD;
    including its content, availability, and ordering.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and&#xD;
    best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used&#xD;
    evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate,&#xD;
    competitive, and useful. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to&#xD;
    be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, and&#xD;
    estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product Backlog items drive&#xD;
    immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product Backlog item has been considered, and the&#xD;
    more consensus exists regarding it and its value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are&#xD;
    made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items&#xD;
    that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one&#xD;
    item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within&#xD;
    one Sprint are deemed “ready” or “actionable” for selection in a Sprint Planning Meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and&#xD;
    more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business&#xD;
    requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work&#xD;
    on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is then employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an&#xD;
    ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog&#xD;
    items. During Product Backlog grooming, items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the&#xD;
    Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Often the&#xD;
    Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the&#xD;
    Scrum Team. Grooming usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping&#xD;
    understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work&#xD;
    remaining at least for every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous&#xD;
    Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information&#xD;
    is made transparent to all stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Various trend burndown, burnup and other projective practices have been used to forecast progress. These have proven&#xD;
    useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is&#xD;
    unknown. Only what has happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    Increment&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. At the&#xD;
    end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum&#xD;
    Team’s &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
