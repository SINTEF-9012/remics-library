&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=MsoBodyText>&lt;SPAN lang=EN-GB>A preliminary description is necessary, so with the System Idea, and some additional information, a description of the system will be obtained.

&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=MsoBodyText>&lt;SPAN lang=EN-GB>One of the objectives of this preliminary description is to serve as a basis for the evaluation of the feasibility of the system. Therefore, during this activity it is possible that more than one description is developed in order to allow the evaluation of different alternatives. Another objective of the System Description is to serve as a brief summary of the nature of the service. It will be useful to acquire a quick idea about the system that it is going to be developed without having to read the entire System Requirements document. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=MsoBodyText>&lt;SPAN lang=EN-GB>In the end, the output of this work will be the System Description, and it will contain relevant information about the system to develop. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=MsoBodyText>&lt;SPAN lang=EN-GB>Users are who have to describe their needs and expectations, while the analysts have to help them in the identification of all the relevant aspects of the system. Finally the users, the analysts and the project manager should agree with the description.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=MsoBodyText>&lt;SPAN lang=EN-GB>This activity has no automation possibilities.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=MsoBodyText>&lt;SPAN lang=EN-GB>There are tools for requirement gathering that can be used in this activity. From REMICS perspective, this activity is not expected to be supported by specific tools developed in the REMICS.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;
